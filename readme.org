** when implementing the parameters i came to the discovery that its not as easy as it seems.
- first implementation was easy:
initialize ui from parameters,
whenever something could be sent to the server update ui and (optionally parameters)
problem is, ui is gone, when the callback from the server comes back (so no way to get from fragment to ui element)
- an own global eventbus, that stores the values could be used
e.g. when starting up the parameters values are put to the eventbus
when something has been changed, the eventbus is updated -> and notifies and updates the ui
